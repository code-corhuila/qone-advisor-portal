# qone-advisor-portal

> advisor bounded context: web UI (remote)

Part of the **Qampus (Quorum One)** distributed system — team `quorum-one`, Grupo 1.
Governance and documentation live in [`qone-docs`](https://github.com/code-corhuila/qone-docs).

## Purpose

The web portal of the **advisor** domain (course norm 5.4, Annex H): the chat with the academic
advisor, the conversations of the signed-in person, and the enrollment plans the agent proposes
with their confirm and dismiss actions and the saga's outcome. It is a Module Federation
**remote** named `advisor` that exposes `./App` (and `./mocks` for synthetic data); `qone-front`
mounts it at `/advisor/*`. The portal owns only its screens: the HTTP client and the session
come from the shell and the portal never knows the gateway URL or the token (norm 5.4.1,
verified on the built bundle by `scripts/check-isolation.sh`). A reply can take up to the
advisor's 120 s budget, so the chat waits longer than the shell's default; a degraded reply
(no model, or the circuit open) is shown as such and the rest of Qampus keeps working (D-02).

Specification: `07-api/contracts/openapi/qone-advisor-api.yaml` (AD-01..AD-08),
`09-microservices/services/06-advisor-api`, ADR-003, ADR-007 and ADR-009 in `qone-docs`.
Stories: `code-corhuila/qone-docs#46` (HU-ADV-002) and `#47` (HU-ADV-003).

## How to run it

Requirements: Node 22 LTS (or 24), npm, and the shell (`qone-front`) running at `VITE_SHELL_URL`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # VITE_SHELL_URL only; .env is ignored by git
npm ci
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5005 (standalone) - or open /advisor in the shell
```

Checks (`ci.yml` runs the same on every pull request):
```bash
npm run typecheck           # TypeScript strict
npm test                    # Vitest + Testing Library + MSW; contract tests against the synced YAML
npm run build               # remoteEntry.js and assets in dist/
npm run check:isolation     # no gateway URL, no token handling, no raw fetch in dist/
```

`npm run contracts:sync [ref]` refreshes the contract copies in `contracts/openapi/` from `qone-docs`.

Container image and compose (`deploy/`, Annex H and G): `docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t
qone-advisor-portal:dev .`, `docker run --rm -p 5005:80 qone-advisor-portal:dev`, then
`deploy/smoke.sh http://localhost:5005`. NGINX serves `remoteEntry.js` to any origin without
caching it and the hashed chunks as immutable; `deploy/compose.yml` is what `qone-infra` includes
(port 5005 published only in `develop`).

## Dependencies

- `qone-front` at `VITE_SHELL_URL`: `shell/apiClient`, `shell/session` and the mount point `/advisor/*`.
- `qone-advisor-api` behind the gateway; with the shell's `VITE_USE_MOCKS=true` the fixtures answer.

## Branching

Three permanent branches. **None of them accepts a direct commit** — you enter through a child
branch and leave through a Pull Request.

```
develop  <--PR--  feat/... fix/... chore/...
qa       <--PR--  qa/...
main     <--PR--  release/...  hotfix/...
```

Promotion happens **by re-application** (`git cherry-pick -x`), never by merging one permanent
branch into another: `merge develop -> qa` and `merge qa -> main` do not exist in this model.

`main` requires **1 approval from `ariel5253`**. On `develop` and `qa` the team sets its own review
rule.

Full policy: `00-governance/branching-policy.md` in `qone-docs`.
